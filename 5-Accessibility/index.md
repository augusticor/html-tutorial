One way to ensure accessibility is to use the correct Hypertext Markup Language elements for the correct purpose at all times, so semantic is not just for SEO and indexing purposes but for make your content accessible.

* Don't

```html
<div>Play video</div>
```

* Do

```html
<button>Play video</button>
```

With using the `<button>` tag, users will be able to navigate to your button using the `Tab` key and submit the action using the `Enter` key.
